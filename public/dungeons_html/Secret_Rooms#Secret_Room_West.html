          Rumors say that upon the top of the Forsaken Tower are two rooms, which hold monsters the likes of which have
          never been seen before. Furthermore, it is said that guilds that are able to vanquish the guardians of these
          rooms will be rewarded with great power and fortune.(Please note that the Secret rooms are treated like a
          weekly siege (only this is PvM, not PvP), and guilds must compete to win access. ). It consists of making your
          way through 100 mutant (giant) tower mobs and then fighting a level 121 boss. This boss will fully heal
          himself if the player he is currently targeting dies or disconnects.

            History
          </b>

          Once thought to be Shades hideout these Masquerpets still guard her throne room which was situated at the very
          top level. She would retreat here to regroup after a long day of mayhem and destruction. She summoned her most
          loyal Masquerpets and they swore an oath to guard it with their lives. With each level comes more challenging
          foes each more eager to for-fill his purpose. In the end Shade destroyed the Throne Room so it would not fall
          into enemy hands but still her loyal subjects guard. Diligently they await the glorious day of her return in
          the hopes of restoring her to her rightful throne.

                  When the secret room opens you get a pop-up which will teleport you to the

                  </a>
                  . Once you are at this NPC you can enter the Secret Room. You only go against the guilds that signed
                  up at the same Secret Room. The siege is also instanced, meanng that even though every registered
                  guild is dong it at the same time, you will only be with your own guild in the Secret Room. But on the
                  left side of your screen you can see the progress of the other guilds.

          Rumors say that upon the top of the Forsaken Tower are two rooms, which hold monsters the likes of which have
          never been seen before. Furthermore, it is said that guilds that are able to vanquish the guardians of these
          rooms will be rewarded with great power and fortune.(Please note that the Secret rooms are treated like a
          weekly siege (only this is PvM, not PvP), and guilds must compete to win access. ). It consists of making your
          way through 100 mutant (giant) tower mobs and then fighting a level 121 boss. This boss will fully heal
          himself if the player he is currently targeting dies or disconnects.

            History
          </b>

          Once thought to be Shades hideout these Masquerpets still guard her throne room which was situated at the very
          top level. She would retreat here to regroup after a long day of mayhem and destruction. She summoned her most
          loyal Masquerpets and they swore an oath to guard it with their lives. With each level comes more challenging
          foes each more eager to for-fill his purpose. In the end Shade destroyed the Throne Room so it would not fall
          into enemy hands but still her loyal subjects guard. Diligently they await the glorious day of her return in
          the hopes of restoring her to her rightful throne.

                  up at the same Secret Room. The siege is also instanced, meanng that even though every registered
                  guild is dong it at the same time, you will only be with your own guild in the Secret Room. But on the
                  left side of your screen you can see the progress of the other guilds.
