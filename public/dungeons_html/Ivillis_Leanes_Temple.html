                  History
               </b>

               Whispering in his ear, Shade talks to him. She tells him to avenge her. �Punish the interlopers of the
               Hill
               of Shade�. Smiling he looks down upon them. Insignificant humans, relishing in the fruits of this sacred
               land. Dancing and laughing in ecstasy of the harvest. They had been warned not to settle here. The
               natives
               tried to tell them of the curse. What shall he do to please his master? Suddenly it comes to him,
               pumpkins;
               he shall turn them all into pumpkins. And they shall guard the hill from others. Bubble, seeing all of
               this,
               whispers in his other ear; �You, how dare you hurt mankind. I shall mark you and all shall know you for
               your
               treachery�. He looks down into the river that passes by the town and he sees that he no longer sports the
               bright costume of his peers. He now bears the colors of the accused. Striped in black and white he flees.
               But where to go? He runs south, away from humans and stumbles upon a fitting site. Before him a skull
               marking the entrance to a dungeon. He hastens his pace, down, down into the bowels of Saint Mornings.
               Infecting all in his path with his evilness. Deep, deep below the surface he finds a refuge. In a small
               chamber he finds himself and Shade tells him all is well. Here no one will bother him. And upon his door
               she
               places a lock. She takes the keystone, brakes it in three and spreads the pieces throughout the dungeon.

               The dark and sinister halls of Ivillis Dungeon are overrun with masquerpets tainted with the evilness of
               Leanes. The winding passages, littered with bones, will test your sense of direction. The monsters within
               will hinder your progress through the dungeon, but if you find the pieces of the keystone you will
               discover
               the entombed enemy. His prison guard Darz will let you in if you meet all the requirements. Come avenge
               the
               souls of Shadia.
